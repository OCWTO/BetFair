Firstly get event types 
 Then call get listEvents with your event type to see all games in the filter
 	Then with an event id from listEvents you call listmarketcatalogue with the id for the game to see options


	Other option is to call listmarketcatalogue for an event which gives you all possible markets options. So for my code output example it was 1 result limit so it returned all markets for full time/half time new england vs san diego so i got tie/new england tie/tie etc.

	Either way with a market selection like tie/tie or picked option->market you call listmarketbook with the id like tie/tie to get back and lay prices
