6/1/14:
	Worked on the Python and Java files. I've looked more into the documentation and I know the methods I need to call to the API
	for exactly what I want. Event list to get all games and then marketbook for an event list id that interests me. I'm starting
	to think about the UI so I know that there's some code thats' unnecessary right now but will be needed in the end for users to 
	pick events they want to monitor. I've found an error on the betfair api pages which caused my python code to get prices for bets
	to not work for almost a week now. It gave the wrong URL to post to which is incredibly annoying... I implemented some Java to get
	event information but it wasn't the correct method, it listed markets like Manchester to win but it wasn't for a particular game. It
	listed all markets like that for all games in my time period but didn't mention the actual game like Manchester Vs Liverpool. It would
	list manchester and liverpool markets and then other game markets without mentioning anything. Huge message today but I did spend quite
	some time today and I've forgotten about my log for a while now. Plan is to fix java code tomorrow and look into prices. I've got some 
	questions regarding the price results and the poster day to ask Richard on Monday.
